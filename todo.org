* DONE Get the pitch conditions working: use an array of 6 integers.
** DONE Understand how to shuffle an array of a given size N
*** Pilfered from cookie1.el in the GNU Emacs sources.
** DONE prepare_pitch(): can print the out_list and also a description of the pitch.
* DONE Implement dice of faces 6, 8, and 10.
** Implemented as macros.
** DONE Take uniform_int_in() from  `gaussian'
* DONE Write ball()
** DONE Write one()
** DONE Write two()
** DONE Write three()
** DONE Write four()
** DONE Write wicket_chance()
*** DONE Write mode_of_dismissal()
**** DONE enums for dismissals?  Or some struct or array?
***** None right now.  Simple switch-case for printing.
** DONE Write big-hit()
** DONE Write extras()
*** DONE wide
*** DONE no ball
*** DONE leg byes
*** DONE byes
** DONE Write dot()
* DONE Manage teams and toss
* DONE Projected scores and match analysis
* DONE Two innings
** DONE Switch innings
** DONE Targets and chasing
* DONE Help function
* DONE Sane commands
* DONE Readme
* DONE Print a description of the result of the match
* DONE Fall of Wickets
** Add an array of 11 ints to the teams.
Waste the 0th slot and fill the rest with the scores when the wickets
fell.  Then, while printing, simply use the index i for the i'th wicket.
* DONE Fix glaring error: byes and leg byes do not contribute to runs.
* DONE Current partnership
** TODO Handle partnerships when the last "wicket" was retired hurt.
* DONE Play a number of matches in succession
Currently, nothing sane happens when trying to begin a new match just
after one has finished.
** Obviated by exiting on finishing.
* DONE Match finished before over finished; over still goes through the motions
* DONE 's' does nothing during the match, but help says it should.
* DONE 42/1 (6.1)  168/2 (18.6)
This should say (19.0)
* DONE <2016-06-22 Wed> nm after nm
Handle the case where there is a match in progress and we type 'nm'.

* DONE Rename hard to grok global variables `t' and `nt' to `bat_team' and 'field_team'.
* TODO Players
** Batsmen: `striker' and `non-striker'
** Bowlers: `bowler' and `non-bowler'?
** Attributes: name, runs, balls, strike rate, 4s, 6s, how_out, fow, overs, maidens, runs, wickets, run rate, keeper?

I imagine another pair of header and source.  A struct that holds the
attributes named in TODO.org; four key player objects at any point of
the game: two batsmen and two bowlers; a new slot in the team struct
that holds 11 players; a whole bunch of hackery in the delivery
procedures/functions.  Key things to look out for: batsmen crossover at
end of over; fall of wickets and determining the mode of dismissal --
finding the player who took a catch is a known pain point from the CL
version; and substitute players if the given fielder was retired hurt in
the earlier innings.  Team data has to be read from a flat file, i.e.,
parsed.  Fun times.
