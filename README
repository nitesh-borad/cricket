Introduction

A cricket simulator on the command-line.


Description

In its current version, this is a program that simulates a 50-over
cricket match between two teams (no players yet), whose names are
provided by the user.  The aim is to offer a realistic simulation.
During a match, every over is played out and the score is kept for each
team's innings.  Additional features include statistics such as the
projected score and the number of boundaries; a brief description of the
condition of the pitch before the start of play; the ability to control
the degree of attack or defense while batting: a more aggressive style
increases the likelihood of scoring runs, but also the chance of losing
wickets.  Vice versa for a more defensive style.

The simulator is written to conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("C99").  As
such, it only uses these facilities of the Standard:

* stdbool.h for the boolean type  bool


Limitations

* No players
* Ignores free-hit rules, powerplay rules, ball change rules


Enhancements possible

* Implementing players
  This is by far the primary feature on the roadmap of enhancements.
* Other minor improvements
  These are mentioned in the items marked `TODO' in the file todo.org


External functionality

A piece of code required case insensitive string comparisons.  There is

        int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

for systems conforming to POSIX.1-2001, but it is not in a Standard C
library.  The wish to stay within the bounds of the C99 standard
motivated the search for a portable solution.

For case insensitive string comparison, `lexcmp' from the Standard
Function Library (c) 1991-2000 by iMatix Corporation has been modified
and used as per the SFL License Agreement found here:
